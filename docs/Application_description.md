### Udagram Dependencies

1. Udagram relies on all open source technology listed in package.json files for both frontend and backend parts of the app
2. Udagram relies on environment variables both on AWS and locally. Here are the names of the variables:

- POSTGRES_USERNAME
- POSTGRES_PASSWORD
- POSTGRES_HOST
- POSTGRES_DB
- AWS_BUCKET
- AWS_REGION
- AWS_PROFILE
- JWT_SECRET
- URL

3. As noted in the env variables, Udagram also needs a postgres database to persist data.
